### Project 3: **Market Microstructure Simulation with Order Book Matching**

**Overview**: Simulate the microstructure of a financial market, focusing on the implementation and testing of various order-matching algorithms, such as FIFO and Pro-rata.

#### Features:

1.  **Order Book Design**

    -   **What**: Implement a realistic order book supporting limit orders, market orders, and cancellations.
    -   **How**: Design the order book as a data structure that processes trades based on price-time priority and other algorithms.
    -   **Concepts**: Binary search, queue management, event-driven simulation.
2.  **Order-Matching Algorithms**

    -   **What**: Implement and test multiple order-matching algorithms, such as FIFO and Pro-rata.
    -   **How**: Use heap-based structures and priority queues for fast insertions and matching of orders.
    -   **Concepts**: Order-matching strategies, heap data structures, priority queues.

#### Challenges:

-   Efficiently managing the order book and handling multiple participants in real time.
-   Ensuring fairness and accuracy in matching orders while minimizing latency.
