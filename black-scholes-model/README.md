### Project 1: **Advanced Black-Scholes Model (Financial Modeling)**

**Goal**: Transform the traditional Black-Scholes model into a comprehensive financial tool with real-time data integration, optimization, and visual analytics.

#### Features:

1.  **Real-Time Market Data Integration**

    -   **What**: Pull live stock prices from financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
    -   **How**: Use RESTful API to fetch real-time data, integrate with the Black-Scholes formula, and dynamically adjust option prices.
    -   **Concepts**: HTTP requests, JSON parsing (using libraries like `jsoncpp` or `Boost.JSON`), and concurrency for background updates.
2.  **Advanced Concurrency and Parallelization**

    -   **What**: Parallelize option price calculations across multiple cores or distributed systems.
    -   **How**: Use `std::async` for task parallelism or extend it with OpenMP for high-performance computations.
    -   **Concepts**: Thread management, parallel computing, load balancing.
3.  **Numerical Optimization and Precision Control**

    -   **What**: Improve numerical stability with alternative models like the Binomial Tree Method.
    -   **How**: Implement additional models, such as finite difference methods, and compare their results for accuracy and performance.
    -   **Concepts**: Mathematical optimization, precision vs. performance trade-offs, computational finance.
4.  **Interactive Front-End with Real-Time Graphing**

    -   **What**: Provide an interactive interface for users to input parameters and visualize real-time option prices.
    -   **How**: Use libraries like `matplotlib-cpp` or Plotly for real-time graphing and updates.
    -   **Concepts**: Front-end development, real-time graphing, and API integration.

#### Bonus Features:

-   **Machine Learning Extension**: Use historical price data to predict volatility and observe its effect on option pricing.
-   **User Authentication**: Add user management to track different portfolios and option pricing.
